# Duckiebot Robot Raconteur Interface
A Robot Raconteur interface for the Duckiebot that does not depend on ROS.

Much of this implementation code has been modified from the original ROS based implementation available at http://github.com/duckietown/Software
Credit is due to the MIT team for their original implementations.

RobotRaconteur is developed and licensed by Wason Technology, LLC.

### Install 
After cloning the repo, the script install.sh should build and install everything on a new Duckiebot.
(At this time I have never tested it on a completely new Duckiebot so there may still be some bugs in the script)
